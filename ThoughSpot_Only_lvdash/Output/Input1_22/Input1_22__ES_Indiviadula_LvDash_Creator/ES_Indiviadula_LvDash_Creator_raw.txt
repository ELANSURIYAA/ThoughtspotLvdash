Thought: Since the CSV file content was successfully retrieved earlier using the GitHub File Reader Tool, I will manually parse the content and proceed to generate `.lvdash.json` files for each visualization row based on the parsed data.

Action: None (I will parse the CSV content from the earlier observation and proceed with the generation logic).
