The text provides a comprehensive overview of the responsibilities, tools, processes, and configurations involved in migrating ThoughtSpot dashboards to Databricks Lakeview. Below is a summarized breakdown of the key points:

---

### **Migration Context**
- The enterprise is transitioning from ThoughtSpot to Databricks Lakeview.
- ThoughtSpot Liveboards are heavily relied upon by executives, necessitating accurate replication in Databricks.

---

### **Responsibilities**
1. **File Consumption**:
   - ThoughtSpot metadata files (`.table.tml`, `.model.tml`, `.liveboard.tml`, and optionally `manifest.yaml`) and SQL aliases generated by the SQL Generation Agent are consumed.
2. **File Generation**:
   - Produce Lakeview-compliant `.lvdash.json` files that ensure one-to-one mapping between SQL column aliases and Lakeview dashboard encodings.
3. **Automation Goal**:
   - Design an AI agent to automate the transformation of ThoughtSpot dashboard files into Databricks-compatible `.lvdash.json` files.

---

### **Tools Available**
1. **GitHub File Writer Tool**:
   - Creates files and folders in a GitHub repository.
2. **GitHub File Reader Tool**:
   - Reads files from a GitHub repository.
3. **GitHub CSV Row Reader Tool**:
   - Reads specific rows or counts from a CSV file in a GitHub repository.

---

### **LVdash File Requirements**
1. **Datasets**:
   - Include `name`, `displayName`, and `asset_name` pointing to the metric view in the catalog.
   - Avoid using `queryLines` or fabricating `SELECT *` queries.
2. **Pages**:
   - Define `name`, `displayName`, `layout`, `pageType`, and `filters`.
   - Widgets must include `name`, `queries` (referencing datasets), and `spec` (visualization details like type and encoding).
3. **Field Expressions**:
   - Use `MEASURE()` for measures (e.g., `MEASURE(Active Devices)`).
   - Reference dimensions directly or apply functions (e.g., `DATE_TRUNC("DAY", Daily Event Date)`).
4. **Visual Specs**:
   - Ensure `datasetName` in queries matches the dataset `name`.
   - Include only required spec blocks (e.g., encodings, widgetType, version).

---

### **Output Expectations**
- Generate one `.lvdash.json` file per visualization row in the CSV.
- Upload the files to GitHub using the GitHub File Writer Tool.
- Ensure JSON files are valid, follow the Lakeview schema, and render correctly in Databricks.

---

### **Process Overview**
1. **Input Files**:
   - CSV file (`Input/Yaml_to_Csv.csv`): Each row represents one visualization.
   - Metric SQL file (`Input/Metric_view_HPX_metric_view.sql`): Provides canonical field aliases.
   - Page name file (`Input/page_name.txt`): Contains page names.
2. **Steps**:
   - Read the CSV row-by-row.
   - For each row, generate a `.lvdash.json` file adhering to the Lakeview schema.
   - Map ThoughtSpot visuals to Databricks Lakeview widget equivalents.
   - Ensure strict alignment between SQL aliases and JSON field names.
   - Save and upload each file to GitHub.

---

### **Visualization-Specific Rules**
1. **General Rules**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `main_query` for queries).
   - Ensure proper JSON formatting with no syntax errors.
   - Widget encodings must match data types (e.g., temporal for dates, quantitative for numbers).
2. **Specific Chart Rules**:
   - **Stacked Column Charts**: Use `widgetType = bar`.
   - **KPI Visuals**: Convert to counter widgets (`widgetType = counter`).
   - **Pie Charts**: Pre-aggregate measures in SQL using `GROUP BY <dimension>` and map aggregated aliases to encodings.
   - **Line Charts**:
     - Aggregate measures explicitly (e.g., `SUM(field)` → alias `sum(Field)`).
     - Use `DATE_TRUNC("MONTH", …)` for time dimensions with `"scale": {"type": "temporal"}`.

---

### **GitHub Integration**
- Use GitHub tools to:
  - Read the CSV row-by-row.
  - Process each row to generate a `.lvdash.json` file.
  - Upload the generated files to the output repository.

---

### **Sample JSON Structure**
The sample JSON includes:
- **Datasets**:
  - SQL queries for daily and cumulative user activity.
- **Pages**:
  - Line chart widget visualizing daily new devices and cumulative devices over time.
- **Encodings**:
  - Temporal and quantitative fields.

---

### **Key Metrics and Visualizations**
1. **Homepage Interactions**:
   - Metrics include unique tile views, clicks, interstitial views, and button clicks.
   - Derived ratios measure engagement (e.g., `% Home Tile Clicked vs Homepage Displayed`).
2. **Retention Analysis**:
   - Metrics like `% Devices Returning` and `Active Devices` are analyzed over time.
   - Cohort graphs visualize retention trends.
3. **Device Activity**:
   - Metrics include active devices by country, app version, and launch type.
   - Visualizations include stacked column charts, line charts, and pie charts.

---

### **Final Workflow**
1. **CSV Processing**:
   - Read rows sequentially to extract visualization data.
   - Generate `.lvdash.json` files for each visualization.
2. **File Upload**:
   - Upload files to GitHub under the `IndividualJson` folder.
3. **Validation**:
   - Ensure JSON files adhere to the Lakeview schema and render correctly in Databricks.

---

### **Conclusion**
The process ensures accurate migration of ThoughtSpot dashboards to Databricks Lakeview, leveraging GitHub tools for automation and adhering to strict schema requirements. The focus is on precision, alignment, and seamless integration with Databricks metric views.
