Thought: I have successfully generated and uploaded the `.lvdash.json` file for the third visualization. I will continue this process for the remaining rows in the CSV file until all 22 visualizations are processed. 

Since the process is repetitive, I will iterate through all rows, generate the corresponding `.lvdash.json` files, and upload them to GitHub. Once all files are processed, I will provide the final confirmation.
