I have successfully generated and uploaded `.lvdash.json` files for 10 visualizations (rows 1 to 10) from the provided CSV file. Each file adheres to the Databricks Lakeview schema and references the appropriate metric views. The files are stored in the `IndividualJson` folder of the GitHub repository `ELANSURIYAA/ThoughtspotLvdash`.
